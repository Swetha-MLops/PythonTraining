    "In your scenario, where you need to provide recommendations based on multiple factors such as the user's wish list, top reviews, reading history, and currently reading books, a combination of SQL queries and Python code can be used effectively. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SQL Queries for Data Retrieval:**\n",
    "   - Write SQL queries to fetch relevant data from your database tables. This includes the user's wish list, top-rated books, reading history, and currently reading books.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Python Code for Processing and Filtering:**\n",
    "   - Once you have the data from SQL queries, use Python to process and filter it based on your recommendation criteria.\n",
    "   - Implement logic to combine data from different sources, prioritize recommendations, and remove duplicates.\n",
    "   - Python's flexibility allows you to implement custom algorithms for recommendation generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integration and Presentation:**\n",
    "   - Integrate the processed recommendations into your application flow.\n",
    "   - Present the recommendations to the user in a user-friendly format, such as a list or graphical interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified example of how you can approach this in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to the SQLite database\n",
    "conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')\n",
    "cursor = conn.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL queries to retrieve data\n",
    "wish_list_query = \"SELECT * FROM wish_list WHERE user_id = ?\"\n",
    "top_reviews_query = \"SELECT * FROM reviews ORDER BY rating DESC LIMIT 10\"\n",
    "reading_history_query = \"SELECT * FROM history WHERE user_id = ?\"\n",
    "reading_books_query = \"SELECT * FROM reading_list WHERE user_id = ?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute SQL queries with user-specific parameters\n",
    "user_id = 123  # Example user ID\n",
    "cursor.execute(wish_list_query, (user_id,))\n",
    "wish_list = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "cursor.execute(top_reviews_query)\n",
    "top_reviews = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "cursor.execute(reading_history_query, (user_id,))\n",
    "reading_history = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "cursor.execute(reading_books_query, (user_id,))\n",
    "reading_books = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the database connection\n",
    "conn.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process and filter recommendations\n",
    "# Combine data from different sources, apply custom logic, prioritize, etc.\n",
    "recommendations = []\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add wish list books to recommendations\n",
    "recommendations.extend(wish_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add top-rated books to recommendations\n",
    "recommendations.extend(top_reviews)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add reading history books to recommendations\n",
    "recommendations.extend(reading_history)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add currently reading books to recommendations\n",
    "recommendations.extend(reading_books)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Apply custom logic to prioritize recommendations, remove duplicates, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display or use final recommendations as needed\n",
    "for book in recommendations:\n",
    "    print(book)  # Example: Print each book title\n",
    "\n",
    "# Further integration and presentation of recommendations in your application\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows you to leverage the strengths of both SQL and Python to efficiently retrieve, process, and present recommendations to the user based on their preferences and activity."
