    "In your scenario, where you need to provide recommendations based on multiple factors such as the user's wish list, top reviews, reading history, and currently reading books, a combination of SQL queries and Python code can be used effectively. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SQL Queries for Data Retrieval:**\n",
    "   - Write SQL queries to fetch relevant data from your database tables. This includes the user's wish list, top-rated books, reading history, and currently reading books.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Python Code for Processing and Filtering:**\n",
    "   - Once you have the data from SQL queries, use Python to process and filter it based on your recommendation criteria.\n",
    "   - Implement logic to combine data from different sources, prioritize recommendations, and remove duplicates.\n",
    "   - Python's flexibility allows you to implement custom algorithms for recommendation generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integration and Presentation:**\n",
    "   - Integrate the processed recommendations into your application flow.\n",
    "   - Present the recommendations to the user in a user-friendly format, such as a list or graphical interface.\n",
    "\n",
