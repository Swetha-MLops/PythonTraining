    "In your scenario, where you need to provide recommendations based on multiple factors such as the user's wish list, top reviews, reading history, and currently reading books, a combination of SQL queries and Python code can be used effectively. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SQL Queries for Data Retrieval:**\n",
    "   - Write SQL queries to fetch relevant data from your database tables. This includes the user's wish list, top-rated books, reading history, and currently reading books.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Python Code for Processing and Filtering:**\n",
    "   - Once you have the data from SQL queries, use Python to process and filter it based on your recommendation criteria.\n",
    "   - Implement logic to combine data from different sources, prioritize recommendations, and remove duplicates.\n",
    "   - Python's flexibility allows you to implement custom algorithms for recommendation generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integration and Presentation:**\n",
    "   - Integrate the processed recommendations into your application flow.\n",
    "   - Present the recommendations to the user in a user-friendly format, such as a list or graphical interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified example of how you can approach this in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to the SQLite database\n",
    "conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')\n",

    "reading_history_query = \"SELECT * FROM history WHERE user_id = ?\"\n",
    "reading_books_query = \"SELECT * FROM reading_list WHERE user_id = ?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute SQL queries with user-specific parameters\n",
    "user_id = 123  # Example user ID\n",
    "cursor.execute(wish_list_query, (user_id,))\n",

    "recommendations.extend(reading_history)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add currently reading books to recommendations\n",
    "recommendations.extend(reading_books)\n",
    "\n",
